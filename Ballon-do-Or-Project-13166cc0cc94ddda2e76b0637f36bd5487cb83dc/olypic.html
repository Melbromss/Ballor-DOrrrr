     <h3>Jean-Pierre Papin</h3>
     <p class="subcon">
          Jean-Pierre Roger Guillaume Papin (born 5 November 1963) is a French football manager and former professional player who played as a forward. He was named the Ballon d'Or and IFFHS World's Top Goal Scorer of the Year in 1991. Papin is the manager of Championnat National 2 club C'Chartres Football. 
          <br><br>

          Papin achieved his greatest success while playing for Marseille between 1986 and 1992. He later played for AC Milan, FC Bayern Munich, Bordeaux, Guingamp, JS Saint-Pierroise and US Cap-Ferret. Papin also played 54 times for the French national team. After a short time as manager of French clubs, he joined the local amateur club AS Facture-Biganos Bo√Øen as a player in 2009, aged 45. 
          <br><br>
          Papin was known for his goalscoring, striking ability and volleys, which his fans nicknamed Papinades in his honour.[2] In a 17-year career in many of Europe's biggest leagues, he scored nearly 350 goals in over 620 matches. 
           <br><br>
          In 1996, after their eight-month-old daughter was shown to have serious cerebral lesions, Jean-Pierre and his wife set up an association "Neuf de Coeur" (Nine of Hearts; Papin's shirt number was 9) to help others in that situation and, particularly, to find and apply methods to mentally and physically educate such children.
