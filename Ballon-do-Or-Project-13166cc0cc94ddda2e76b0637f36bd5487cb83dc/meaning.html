          <h1>What's The Ballon d'Or !?</h1>
          <img src="Project Club Logo/Ballonss.jpg" alt="Ballons">
          <p>The Ballon d'Or is an annual football award presented by the French news magazine France Football, one of the oldest and most prestigious awards for individuals. Soccer player. While FIFA also returns to itself as a separate annual award, fifa men play co-recipients of the FIFA Ballon d'Or is considered the winner of both organizations the award was conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot, the Ballon d'Or award to honour the male player considered the best performer of the previous year, based on the vote of football journalists, from 1956 to 2006. In 1995, the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin ever active at European clubs. The award became a global award in 2007, with all professional footballers from around the world eligible to participate. <br>


               Ballon d'Or is not the world's best player of the year award. But the greatest of the throne is the 1st in the world (the player who will receive this award must play for a UEFA-affiliated football club to be eligible for the award). The FIFA World Player of the Year award is the world's best player award, but the greatness of this award is secondary to the throne, even though the throne is Europe's best player award (no, puzzling, right?). As before2 The award was once merged into the same program called FIFA Banglangor, but it was magical. The same people as Messi CR7 finally separated the prize from the original.
